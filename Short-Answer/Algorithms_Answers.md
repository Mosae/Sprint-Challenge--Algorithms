#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)
O(1) A constant runtime. If the input size ever got bigger than n, then the code won't run.
So as long as the input is smaller than n, it wont affect the runtime or space used

b)
O(n) Linear. If the input increases, looping within the range will also increase.

c) O(1) Consant runtime. for every input > 0, we will perform 1 function execution

## Exercise II
